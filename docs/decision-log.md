## 2026-07-18 — Cloud batch transcription after explicit consent

MicDrop will use cloud batch transcription after explicit user analysis consent rather than requiring on-device transcription for every MVP platform.

### Context

R0A proves local capture and playback only. Audio formats, browser support, device performance, and native model packaging differ across iPhone, Android, iPad, Chromium, and Safari. Transcription is not required to prove the first speaking repetition.

### Alternatives considered

- On-device transcription on every platform.
- Cloud streaming transcription during recording.
- Cloud batch transcription after the recording is complete and the user opts into analysis.

### Tradeoffs

Cloud batch transcription keeps the recording loop small, avoids platform-specific model packaging, and allows cost/retention controls. It introduces upload latency, privacy/consent requirements, provider cost, and a future backend dependency. On-device transcription would improve offline privacy but increases binary size, battery use, model maintenance, and cross-platform parity risk. Streaming is unnecessary for the first analysis slice and creates higher latency and cost complexity.

### Refactor trigger

Revisit this decision if offline transcription becomes a contractual requirement, privacy policy prohibits cloud processing, analysis latency exceeds the product target, or recurring transcription cost exceeds the approved per-recording budget.
